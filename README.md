Twitter Bucket
==============
Twitter Bucket is an easy way to find interesting tweets and put them in a bucket beside each other. It is an alternative to starring tweets using the twitter interface, with the advantage of being local and private. 

Demo: []

I used the following Javascript frameworks in development: 
- Backbone.js
- Underscore.js
- JQuery

The following external resources are used as well: 
- normalize.css to reset the default styling [http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/]
- Font Awsome for search, refresh, and bucket icons [http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/]
